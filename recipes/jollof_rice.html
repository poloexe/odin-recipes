    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africa's most popular dish.
    I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li> 
        <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped into 1 to 2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, 
        and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside. </li>

        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. 
        Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, 
        thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined. </li>

        <li>Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste. </li>

        <li>Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice. </li>

        <li>Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid. </li>

        <li>After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro. </li>
    </ol>
